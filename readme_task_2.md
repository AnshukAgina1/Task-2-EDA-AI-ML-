# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (AI & ML Internship)

## Objective
The goal of this task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

## Dataset
- **Titanic dataset** ([Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset))
- Downloaded and analyzed in Google Colab.

## Steps Performed
1. **Loaded and explored dataset**
   - Used `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()` to view structure, datatypes, and summary statistics.

2. **Generated summary statistics**
   - Mean, median, standard deviation, min/max values using Pandas.

3. **Visualized distributions**
   - Plotted **histograms** for numerical features (Age, Fare).
   - Plotted **boxplots** to detect spread and outliers.

4. **Analyzed feature relationships**
   - Created a **correlation heatmap** to check relationships between features.
   - Used **pairplots** to visualize interactions between Age, Fare, Pclass, and Survived.

5. **Identified patterns and trends**
   - Higher survival rate for females compared to males.
   - Passengers in 1st class had higher chances of survival compared to 3rd class.
   - Younger passengers tended to have better survival rates.

6. **Created categorical plots**
   - Count plots for Survival by Gender and Class.

## Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook: `task2.ipynb`
- README documentation (this file)
